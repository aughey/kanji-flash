# Kanji Flash Cards

This was created in order to quickly study RTK flashcards while on the go.
This is 98% of what Koohii and Anki is, but specialized for on-the-go
review of specific sections.  Most notably, it allows you to control the
good, bad, flip, and undo commands from a Bluetooth gamepad.

## How is it different from Anki?

Anki is designed as a Spaced Repetition flashcard system to teach you
a deck of flashcards.  If you have a 2200 card deck, Anki's algorithm
will only show you a specific set of new cards and review cards each
day.  This is great when you are learning from Anki, but not so great
when you are reviewing.

What this system does is allows you to specify a range of RTK cards
to review, and will show you EVERY card in that range.  For my work,
I'm using the RTK book to 'learn' the Kanji, and then using Koohii
and this flash card system to review sections that I need to work on.

## How is it different from Koohii

It is REALLY close to the Kanji Review section of koohii.  Except for
a few minor differences

* If you get a card wrong, koohii will not show it again.  It simply
marks it as bad, and shows you at the end.  But it doesn't reshuffle
it into the review deck

* This system uses a paired Bluetooth gamepad to send the good, bad,
flip, and undo commands.  For my review, I'll setup my phone on a stand
and hold a gamepad in my hand.  This gives me tactile control of the
system without having to rely on touch accuracy.  When doing a secondary
task like watching TV or simple chores, this allows me to incorporate
review into my day without needing to focus 100% of my mental AND physical
energy.
